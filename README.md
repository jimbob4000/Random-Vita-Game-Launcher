Spend too long choosing a game to play, or you don't get around to trying new games? Use this app to select and launch a game at random.


## What does it do?

When you launch this app it will choose a PS Vita game at random for you to play and start it for you.

By default only PS Vita games are chosen at random, however you customise the list of games to include in the settings, to add homebrew games, or to remove games you don't want to play.

## Installation
Install the VPK file from the [latest release](https://github.com/jimbob4000/Random-Vita-Game-Launcher/releases) 

## Using the app

To launch a random PS Vita game, simply start the app.

By default only PS Vita games are selected at random, this is to prevent unwanted homebrew apps from being opened.

**How to include homebrew games:**

* To include homebrew games in the randomisation, press the settings icon on the livearea screen of the application.
* You will be presented with a list of games and homebrew apps.
* Scroll through the list and press 'X' to add or remove a selected game.
* To save your settings press 'O'.
